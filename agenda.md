## Open Questions / Things to Discuss with Tutor

- What exactly are the deliverables for this project?  
- How essential is Dutch fluency, and for what parts of the task?  
- Are we expected to transcribe and annotate the video recordings ourselves?  
- How do we access and interpret the teacher observations?  
- What technologies are acceptable or recommended for video/audio/NLP analysis?  
- Are there any examples or previous projects we can refer to?

## Tech Stack (Tentative)

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `OpenCV` – for video analysis  
  - `Whisper` – for speech-to-text  
  - `spaCy` – for NLP pattern detection  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – for data wrangling  
  - `Matplotlib`, `Plotly` – for visualization  
- **Tools**:  
  - GitHub  
  - Code editor of choice (VS Code, Zed, Neovim)  
  - Jupyter for prototyping  
  - Discord/WhatsApp for comms  
- **Infrastructure**: Local dev environment for now, optional Docker setup later
